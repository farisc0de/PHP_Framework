# Welcome to the PHP MVC Framework

This is a simple MVC framework for building web applications in PHP. It's free and [open-source](LICENSE).

It is an enhanced version of the one created for the [Write PHP Like a Pro: Build an MVC Framework from Scratch](https://davehollingworth.com/go/phpmvc/) course.
